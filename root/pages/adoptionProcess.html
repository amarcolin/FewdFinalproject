            <p>Thank you for considering adopting instead of shopping!</p>

                <h2>Steps to Adoption</h2>
                <p>Adoption Hours are most Saturdays from 11-2 at the Well Pet Clinic in Lexington Park, MD.  The general public is welcome to come meet our available animals, but due to Covid-19 Restrictions, we are limited to the number of visitors we may host at one time.</p>
                <h3>Step 1 - Fill out Application</h3>
                <p>If you are ready to adopt, come to the Well pet Clinic in Lexington Park, MD ask a volunteer for an application for adoption and complete it honestly and accurately.  After a period of onsite review by our volunteers and administrators, you will be told if your application is approved or not.  This usually takes about 15 minutes.</p>
                <h3>Step 2 - FINALIZE YOUR ADOPTION</h3>
                <p>Sign our contract. We will be including the contents of the contract here soon, but basically it states that you will provide for the animal appropriately, not tie the animal out, or let the animal roam (including cats which are indoor only!!) You will also have to agree to bring the animal back to us if things do not work out for you. You cannot take the animal to a shelter or pass the animal on to another person (even a friend or family member) unless approved by us.</p>
                <h3>Step 3 - Pay the Adoption Fee</h3>
                <p>Pay the adoption fee ($175 for cats, $200 for dogs)*. If this sounds like a lot to you, and you are considering a "free" pet from your local newspaper, please consider this: All of our dogs/puppies are spayed/neutered, have current shots, wormed, tested for heartworms, treated for fleas (advantage) and current on heartworm medication (generally heartguard) if appropriate. All our cats/kittens are spayed/neutered, have current vaccinations, tested for feline leukemia and feline AIDS, wormed, treated for fleas (advantage), and ear mites if appropriate. When you also consider our costs for food, equipment, medical care, etc., you can see why that the term non-profit really fits! (By the way, we are always in need of donations, whether money, blankets, towels, newspapers, pet supplies, pet food, etc! We will be also be glad to come pick up large items such as kennels, crates, dog houses, etc)</p>
                <h3>LET THE "HONEYMOON" PERIOD BEGIN!</h3>
                <p>You're done! Take your new friend home and get settled in!! An animal usually takes at least 2 weeks (what we call the "Honeymoon Period") to become comfortable in their new environment.  Their true personality emerges as they learn where they belong in their new family.  Please call us if you have any concerns or need any additional information. We want to make the transition as easy as possible for you and your pet!</p>
                <p>
                We expect all our adopted animals to be kept inside and treated as members of the family.  We expect them to receive annual vet care and be kept in good health.  We also do not approve of declawing cats.  We take great strides to ensure that the animals in our care are loved, respected, and cared for, so we expect that quality of care to be maintained for the animal's entire life.
