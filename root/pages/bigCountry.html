                        <h4>About Big Country</h4>
                        <p>Big Country has an unknown history, but it may not have been a pleasent one.  At some point in his young life, he sustained a substantial hip injury that was never treated.  The traumatic event, however, did not impact his personality.  This boy is ALL LOVE.  He has a wondereful nature, and loves to play, go for gentle walks and lay at your feet.  He's smart and knows a few commands.  He loves his canine companions.  He's curious about the cat, is excited by birds and squirrels, and is determined to find the toad in the backyard that continues to elude him.</p> 
                        <p>Country has a long life ahead of him.  He will become a treasured companion.  BUT... in a couple years he may need surgery on his left hip.  ARF has consulted with local vets and a surgeon to understand the severity of his injury.  Though his hip is fractured, it has healed with scar tissue that has allowed him near normal mobility.  He may never have additional issues, but it is possible that without surgery, arthritis and muscle deterioation will occur, and he will live with terrible pain. </p>
                        <p>Big Country will need a dedicated and financially stable caregiver to maintain his regimen of prescription food, joint supplements, and possible surgery with physical therapy.  He will be worth EVERY penny.</p>
                        <p>If you can't adopt Big Country, but would like to meet him, and make a donation toward his medical costs (x-rays alone were $1000), please come visit him at the Well Pet Clinic in Lexington Park on Saturday!</p>
